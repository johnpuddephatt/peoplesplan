          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>We gather and use certain information about individuals in order to enable certain functionality on this website.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Website usage data</li>
          </ul>


          <h3>Signed in visitors using an OAuth provider</h3>
          <p>The following data is collected from visitors using an OAuth provider (i.e. social login such as Facebook or Twitter):</p>

            <li>User avatar</li>
            <li>Provider ID (this is the ID number of your account on the respective service)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>When using an OAuth provider for the first time you will be asked to confirm that you wish to share your information with us. We strongly encourage you to read this information clearly.</p>
